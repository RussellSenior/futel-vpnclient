Here is a build that seems to work, located in:

  bin-lede-4099-g4c3953ba29-airrouter-futel-work-in-progress

This is the build product from my build, including a bunch of packages
that you don't need.  It also includes the files overlay and LEDE-Project 
.config stub (config.diff) that I used in building.  The ssh credentials are
root/test (you should change the password by logging in and running the passwd
command, just like on a normal unix box.  The build also includes the web
admin interface, luci.  I have not tested luci at all.  The image includes the 
openvpn keys and ca cert you provided.

The binary to flash to your device is located in:

  bin-lede-4099-g4c3953ba29-airrouter-futel-work-in-progress/targets/ar71xx/generic/lede-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-airrouter-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin

You can recreate an image yourself by checking out LEDE with:

  git clone https://git.lede-project.org/source.git lede
  cd lede

copy in the bin-lede-4099-g4c3953ba29-airrouter-futel-work-in-progress/config.diff to .config
recursively copy (i.e. cp -a) from bin-lede-4099-g4c3953ba29-airrouter-futel-work-in-progress/files to files

  make defconfig
  make -j{N} BUILD_LOG=1 V=s

(where {N} is the number of cores on your build box)

If everything goes well, you should end up with an image in bin/targets/ar71xx/generic/
For the Ubiquiti AirRouter, the images are lede-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-airrouter-squashfs-*.bin

The firmware upgrade procedure is described at
https://lede-project.org/docs/user-guide/ssh-firmware-upgrade
https://lede-project.org/docs/guide-quick-start/sysupgrade.luci

The sysupgrade image is used if openwrt or lede is already on the router. Otherwise the factory image is used.
Use the -n argument to erase any exisiting config.

  sysupgrade -v -n /tmp/<image>.bin

Note, the build will chew up a bunch of disk space.  On the order of 20 gigabytes (rough guess).

You can read details about the build system here:

  https://lede-project.org/docs/guide-developer/install-buildsystem

The wifi is disabled by default.  You can only ssh in from a LAN port.  The LAN network
is 192.168.1.0/24 by default.  I'm sure I'm forgetting something(s).  Please ask if you 
run into any trouble.
